# Fetch-API-Typicode-Project

Small project that uses the Fetch API and the JSON Placeholder API to make POST requests and add data to the DOM.

The Fetch API makes a GET request to the JSON Placeholder API and receives 5 'todos', which are added to the DOM.

**How does it work?**

Using the HTML form, the user can add their own todo objects, and send them back to the server through a POST request, and add the same todo the same HTML page containing the HTML form.

The project is an example of Asynchronous JavaScript concept as the Fetch API returns a Promise().

The project combines the following topics and concepts:

* styling using CSS
* HTML Forms
* DOM manipulation
* DOM selectors
* Page load events
* Event handlers
* Form submission
* High-order array methods
* Arrow functions
