# Fetch-API-Typicode-Project

A project that uses the Fetch API and the JSON Placeholder API to make POST requests and add data to the DOM.

The Fetch API makes a Get request to the JSON Placeholder API and receives 5 'todos', which are added to the DOM.

Using the HTML form, the user can add their own todo objects, and send them back to the server through a POST request, and add the same todo the same HTML page containing the HTML form.

The project is an example of Asynchronous JavaScript concept as the Fetch API returns a Promise().

It also uses styling with CSS, HTML forms, and incorporates JS concepts such as DOM Manipulation, DOM Selectors, Page Loading, Event Handlers, the Event Object, Form Submission, High-order Array Methods (forEach), and Arrow Functions.
